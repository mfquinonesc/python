# Binomial Distribution 
# Binomial Distribution is a Discrete Distribution 

# It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin, it will either be head or tails.

# It has three parameters 
# n = number of trials 
# p = probability of occurence of each trial (e.g. for toss of a coin 0.5 each)
# size = The shape of the returned array 

from numpy import random 

x = random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=10)
print(x)

# Visualization of Binomial Distribution 

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 

sns.displot(random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=1000))

plt.show()

# Difference Between Normal and Binomial Distribution 
# The main difference is that normal distribution is continous whereas binomial is discrete, but if there are enough data ponint it will be quite similar to normal distribution with certain loc and scale.

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 

data = {
    "normal": random.normal(loc=50, scale=5, size=1000),
    "binomial": random.binomial(n=100, p=0.5, size=1000)
}
sns.distplot(data, kind="kde")
