# Logistic Distribution 
# Logistic distribution is used to describe growth
# Used extensively in machine learning in logistic regressin, neural networks etc.
# It has three parameters: 
# loc - mean, where the peak is. Default 0.
# scale - standard deviation, the flatness of distribution. Default 1
# size - the shape of the returned array

from numpy import random 

x = random.logistic(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))
print(x)

# Visualization of Logistic Distribution

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 

sns.displot(random.logistic(size=1000), kind='kde')
plt.show()

# Difference Between Logistic and Normal Distribution
# Both dsitribution are near identical, but logistic distribution has more area under the tails, meaning it reresents more possibitlity of occurrence of an event further away from mean.
# For higher value of scale (standard deviation) the normal and logistic distribution are near identical apart from the peak.

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 

data = {
    "normal": random.normal(scale=2, size=1000),
    "logistic": random.logistic(size=1000)
}
