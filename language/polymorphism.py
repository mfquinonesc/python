# Python Polymorphism 

# The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/fucntions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes 

x = "Hello World!"
print(len(x))

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(mytuple))

thisdict = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

print(len(thisdict))

# Class Polymorphism
# Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.

# For example, say we have three classes: car, boat, plane and they all have a method called move()

class Car: 
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def move(self):
        print('Drive!')

class Boat:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def move(self):
        print('Sail!')

class Plane:    
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def move(self):
        print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20")
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")

for x in (car1,  boat1, plane1):
    x.move()

# Create a class called Vehicle and make Car,  Boat, Plane chid classes of Vehicle

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    
    def move(self):
        print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle): 
    pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print('Sail!')

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Fly!")
