# Simple Arithmetic 

# Simple Arithmetic 
# You could use arithmetic operators + - * / directly between NumPy arrays, but this section discusses an extension of th same where we have fucntions that can take any array-like objects e.g. lists, tuples, etc. and perform arithmetic conditionally 

# All of the discussed arithmetic fucntions take a where parameter in which we can specify that condition.

# Addition 
# The add() function  sums the content of two arrays, and return the results in a new array.

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])
arr2 = np.array([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25])

newarr = np.add(arr1,arr2)
print(newarr)

# Subtraction 
# The subtract() function subtracts the value from one array with the values from another array, and return the results in a new array.


import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25])

newarr = np.subtract(arr1,arr2)
print(newarr)

# Multiplication
# The multiply() function multiplies the values from one array with the values from another array, and return the results in a new array.

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25])

newarr = np.multiply(arr1, arr2)

print(newarr)


# Division 
# The divide() function divides the values from one array with the values from another array, adn return  the result in a new array.

import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([3, 5, 10, 8, 2, 33])

newarr = np.divide(arr1, arr2)

print(newarr)


# Power 
# The power() function rises the values from the frist array to the power of the values of the second array, and return the result ina new array 

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([3, 5, 6, 8, 2, 33])

newarr = np.power(arr1, arr2)

print(newarr)


# Remainder 
# Both the mod() and the remainder() functions return the remainder of the values in the first array vorresponding to the values in the second array, and retrun the results in a new array. 

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([3, 7, 9, 8, 2,  33])

newarr = np.mod(arr1, arr2)

print(newarr)

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]) 
arr2 = np.array([3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 33])

newarr = np.remainder(arr1, arr2)

print(newarr)

# Quatient and Mod 
# The divmod() function return both the quotient and the mod. The return value is two arrays, the first array contains the quotient and second array contains the mod 

import numpy as np 

arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
arr2 = np.array([3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 33])


# The first array represents the quatients, the second represents the remainders of the same division.
newarr = np.divmod(arr1, arr2)
print(newarr)


# Absolute Values
# Both the absolute() and the abs() functions do the same absolute operation element-wise but we should use absolute() to avoid confusion with python's inbuilt math.abs()

import numpy as np 

arr = np.array([-1, -2, 1, 2, 3, -4])
newarr = np.absolute(arr)
print(newarr)
